1. File path: /Users/przemek/dev/rm-catalog/src/utils/CharactersProcessor.test.ts
2. Type: TESTS
3. Purpose: Test the functionality of the `getTopCharacters` function to ensure it handles edge cases correctly and returns the appropriate subset of characters.
4. Content: 
   - The file uses the Vitest testing framework to specify test scenarios for the `getTopCharacters` function.
   - It imports characters and the testing function from different modules.
   - Defines a test suite `CharactersProcessor` with tests to:
     - Verify that passing an empty array to `getTopCharacters` returns an empty array.
     - Verify that passing an array of characters along with a limit returns the correct subset of characters according to the limit.
   - Uses an array of `Character` objects, each with detailed properties, to test these scenarios.
5. Tech stack: TypeScript, Vitest
