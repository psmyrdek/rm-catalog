2. Type
   CODE

3. Purpose
   To define TypeScript interfaces that enforce type-safety for environment variables in a Vite project.

4. Content
   The code contains TypeScript interface declarations. `ImportMetaEnv` specifies the types for different environment variables (`VITE_ENV_NAME`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_AWS_MONITORING_API`), all of which are strings and are read-only. `ImportMeta` extends the global `ImportMeta` to include the `ImportMetaEnv` type for the `env` property, ensuring environment variables are accessed in a type-safe manner.

5. Tech stack
   TypeScript, Vite
