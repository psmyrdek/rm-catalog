- Creates an instance of Featurevisor with a datafile URL based on the environment name.
- Renders the application within the 'app' DOM element using React.StrictMode, FeaturevisorProvider, and RouterProvider components.

## Main Functions:
1. `initSentry()`: Initializes the Sentry error tracking system.
2. `createInstance()`: Creates an instance of Featurevisor with a specific datafile URL based on the environment name.
