1. File path: /Users/przemek/dev/rm-catalog/src/App.tsx
2. Type: CODE
3. Purpose: This file defines the main React component for the application, handling the base layout and routing logic conditionally based on the application's readiness status.
4. Content: The file establishes a React component named `App` that utilizes a hook `useStatus` from '@featurevisor/react' to check if the app is ready. If ready, it renders the `Outlet` component from `react-router-dom`, which enables nested routing. The component displays a static header with the title 'ðŸš€ Rick and Morty!'
5. Tech stack: React, React Router, @featurevisor/react
